1. ArchiveBot

    <SketchCow> Coders, I have a question.
    <SketchCow> Or, a request, etc.
    <SketchCow> I spent some time with xmc discussing something we could
                do to make things easier around here.
    <SketchCow> What we came up with is a trigger for a bot, which can
                be triggered by people with ops.
    <SketchCow> You tell it a website. It crawls it. WARC. Uploads it to
                archive.org. Boom.
    <SketchCow> I can supply machine as needed.
    <SketchCow> Obviously there's some sanitation issues, and it is root
                all the way down or nothing.
    <SketchCow> I think that would help a lot for smaller sites
    <SketchCow> Sites where it's 100 pages or 1000 pages even, pretty
                simple.
    <SketchCow> And just being able to go "bot, get a sanity dump"

2. Running it

To run, you will need a Redis server, a Ruby 1.9+ environment, and
Bundler.

   bundle install
   ruby bot.rb --help

To start processing jobs, you'll also need to start Sidekiq:

   sidekiq
