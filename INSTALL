ArchiveBot Installation
=======================

Backend (aka Bot)
=================

To run the bot, you will need:

- a Redis 2.8+ server
- a CouchDB server
- a Ruby 1.9 installation
- Bundler

(Little known fact: ArchiveBot is made to be as hard as possible to set
up.)

Quick install, for Debian and Debian-esque systems:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install bundler couchdb git tmux
    git clone https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot.git
    cd ArchiveBot
    git submodule update --init
    bundle install

It is recommended that you build Redis from source (from
http://redis.io); version 2.8 or higher is recommended.

Set up CouchDB by creating the "archivebot" and "archivebot_logs"
databases. Upload the design documents from db/design_docs. (You can use
CURL or go to http://localhost:5984/_utils/index.html.)

Once that's all in place, run the following:

    redis-server   # ensure it has no password
    export REDIS_URL='redis://localhost:6379/0' # or whatever you need
    export RSYNC_URL='rsync://yourupload.example.com/some-module/'
    bundle exec ruby bot.rb -s 'irc://server.example.org:6667' \
      -c '#archivebot'

The bot should join the IRC channel.

You can run the dashboard webapp on the same machine, or a different
machine:

    bundle exec ruby dashboard/app.rb --redis 'redis://10.0.0.1:6379/0'

Configure twitter_conf.json if you want to post Twitter Tweets.

Run the cogs:

    bundle exec ruby cogs/app.rb

To upgrade, run `git pull` and restart.

bot.rb, dashboard/app.rb, and cogs/app.rb accept a --help option. Run
them with --help to see accepted options.


Crawler (aka Pipeline)
======================

To run the pipeline, you will need:

- a Python 3.3+ installation
- Pip (for Python 3.3+)
- seesaw
- rsync
- wpull

Quick install, for Debian and Debian-esque systems:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential python3-dev python3-pip \
      libxml2-dev libxslt-dev zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev \
      git screen

Set up a dedicated account:

  adduser archivebot

As user archivebot:

    ssh-keygen
      [keep hitting Enter]
    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
      [send the public key to yipdw]
    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot
    cd ArchiveBot
    git submodule update --init
    pip3 install --user -r pipeline/requirements.txt
    pip3 install --user wpull

As user archivebot, in first screen session:

    ssh -C -L 127.0.0.1:16379:127.0.0.1:6379 \
      yourusername@archivebot.at.ninjawedding.org -N

As user archivebot, in second screen session:

    cd ~/ArchiveBot/pipeline
    export RSYNC_URL=rsync://fos.textfiles.com/archivebot/
    export REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:16379/0
    ~/.local/bin/run-pipeline3 pipeline.py --disable-web-server \
      --concurrent 2 ignorednick

Adjust --concurrent as needed.

To gracefully stop:

    touch ~/ArchiveBot/pipeline/STOP

To upgrade, run:

    pip3 install --user --upgrade -r pipeline/requirements.txt
    pip3 install --user --upgrade wpull
