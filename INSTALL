To run, you will need:

- a Redis server
- a Python 2.7 installation
- a Ruby 1.9 installation
- Bundler
- the Lua socket library
- redis-py
- wget+lua

(Little known fact: ArchiveBot is made to be as hard as possible to set
up.)

Quick install, for Debian and Debian-esque systems:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install liblua5.1-dev lua-socket bundler python-pip \
      python2.7-dev gnutls-dev git tmux
    pip install --user seesaw redis
    git clone https://github.com/ArchiveTeam/ArchiveBot.git
    cd ArchiveBot
    git submodule update --init
    ./get-wget-lua.sh
    bundle install

It is recommended that you build Redis from source (from
http://redis.io); the latest Debian package (as of September 2013) is
2.4.14.  That might work, but 2.6.16 is recommended.

Once that's all in place, run the following:

    redis-server   # ensure it has no password
    export REDIS_URL='redis://localhost:6379/0' # or whatever you need
    export RSYNC_URL='rsync://yourupload.example.com/some-module/'
    ruby bot.rb -s 'irc://server.example.org:6667' -c '#archivebot'
    ~/.local/bin/run-pipeline --disable-web-server --concurrent 3 \
      pipeline.py ArchiveBot

You can run the dashboard webapp on the same machine, or a different
machine:

    ruby dashboard/app.rb --redis 'redis://10.0.0.1:6379/0'

Both bot.rb and dashboard/app.rb accept a --help option.  Run them with
--help to see accepted options.
